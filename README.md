# [**WORK IN PROGRESS**] Plotly Dash Snippets Plugin 

This is a snippets extension plugin for Visual Studio Code for the Plotly Dash microframework.

[Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) is a great Open Source/Enterprise tool for technical business/data analysts to share their data within their organisations. Plotly Dash in Python can be considered as the equivalent of what the React framework is in JavaScript.

## Features

The snippets in this pluggin cover components from the Dash HTML Components & Dash Core Components and Dash Boostrap Components Python packages.

All snippets start with the prefix `dash`. 

For example, predefined Dash HTML Components start with the prefix `dashhtml`, Dash Core Component start with the prefix `dashcore` .

In addition, abstractions such as callbacks live on their own (e.g. for a uncontrolled callback, you would call `dashcb`, while for a controlled stateful callback, you would call `dashcbstate`)

## To do

- Create snippets for Dash Bootstrap Components (developed by [faculty.ai](https://faculty.ai)) & Plotly packages. Ideally, Plotly objects should start with `dashplotly` & Dash Bootstrap Components should start with the prefix `dashboot` 

- Create snippets for other abstractions [?]
